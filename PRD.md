# PRD: Talent Screening & Interview Scheduling Agent

## Problem Statement
Recruitment teams spend excessive time screening resumes, coordinating interviews, and managing candidate communication across disconnected systems. This slows hiring, introduces bias, and creates poor candidate experience.

This agent autonomously screens candidates, schedules interviews, and manages pipeline state while keeping humans in control of final decisions.
